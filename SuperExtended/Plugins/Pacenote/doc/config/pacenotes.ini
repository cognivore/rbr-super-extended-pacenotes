;
; This file lists the available pace note calls and defines the layout of the
; pacenote properties dialog.
;
; The pace notes are grouped into categories.
; Each category represents a TAB in the pacenote properties UI dialog.
;
; This file is processed in order, so the ordering of the categories and notes
; in the file reflects the order of the TABs and pacenotes in the pacenote
; properties UI dialog.
;
; The layout of each TAB is defined by the column index specified for each
; pace note entry:
;
;   column=<COLUMN_INDEX>
;
;   where
;   <COLUMN_INDEX>
;       Zero-based column index of the pacenote in the grid of the category's
;       TAB in the pacenote properties dialog.
;       A column index of 0 (zero) always starts a new row in the UI grid.
;       A negative index (-1) defines an invisible pacenote. Such a pacenote
;       is not shown in the properties dialog. Use this to e.g. replace the
;       sound file.
;
; You can define as many categories as you want.
;
; Note:
; An internal, fixed category MODIFIER is always shown in the UI as the second
; TAB. This one contains the pre-defined flags being used by the legacy RBR
; implementation and some additions.
;
;
;
; A pacenote call is defined as follows:
;
; [PACENOTE::<PACENOTE_NAME>]
; id=<ID>
; Sounds=<NUMBER OF SOUNDS>
; Snd<n>=<SOUND_NAME>::<SOUND FILE n>
; link=<NAME OF LINK CALL>
; standard=<NAME OF STANDARD CALL>
; column=<COLUMN_INDEX>
;
; where
;   <PACENOTE_NAME>
;       The unique name of the pacenote call.
;       The name must not represent a number, e.g. "50", as these are reserved
;       for range calls.
;       You should use only ASCII uppercase letters here to simplify things.
;       This name should be translated into each language in use and added to
;       the [STRINGS] section with the <PACENOTE_NAME> as the key in one of
;       the language specific package, category, local or global "strings.ini"
;       file.
;       E.g. EASYLEFT ==> strings.ini: EASYLEFT=Easy Left
;
;   id=<ID>
;       The unique id of the pacenote call.
;       Standard RBR uses values [0..32].
;       Basically only values below 4000 are allowed.
;       Values in the range 0-1000 are reserved for track creators.
;       For your own custom pacenotes you should use values above 1000.
;
;   Sounds=<NUMBER OF SOUNDS>
;       The number of sounds for this call specified by the Snd<n> entries.
;
;   Snd<n>
;       <n> is the zero-based index of the sound file.
;       Start <n> with 0 (zero) and increment by 1 for each additional sound
;       file!
;
;   <SOUND_NAME>
;       The (optional) name of the sound to be displayed in the UI and in the
;       TSV export file. Separated by a double-colon.
;       The translated text is being read as usual from the corresponding
;       strings.ini file.
;       E.g.
;       Snd0=chick_0.ogg
;       Snd1=CHICKS::chick_1.ogg
;
;   <SOUND FILE n>
;       The name of the sound file to play, including the .ogg extension.
;
;   If no sound file is specified or the file does not exist in the language
;   specific folder the callout handler tries to use RBR's legacy sound
;   having the specified name.
;   This is of course only valid for the known pacenote calls like EASYLEFT,
;   OVERCREST etc. These are hard-coded in RBR and cannot be changed.
;
;   link=<NAME OF LINK CALL>
;       This entry has two effects:
;       I. Distance Calculation
;       If this entry is missing or left empty, then this pacenote will not be
;       recognized by the distance calculation algorithm. That means when
;       calculating the distance to the next pacenote, this one will be
;       skipped.
;       II. Call For Short Distances
;       The name of the pacenote call being used for distances less than about
;       10 meters.
;       Standard RBR uses INTO for most calls, ONTO only for bridges.
;       Leave this empty if you do not want the corresponding call to be
;       emitted by the callout handler.
;       See KEEPRIGHT for an example.
;       Standard RBR doesn't emit INTO calls for the following notes:
;           FINISH
;           BUMP
;           GOSTRAIGHT
;           OVERCREST
;           JUMP
;           KEEPRIGHT
;           KEEPLEFT
;           KEEPMIDDLE
;
;   standard=<NAME OF STANDARD CALL>
;       The name of the original (legacy) call to be used for this pacenote if
;       the enhanced callout handler of the plugin is not active or if the DLS
;       (pacenotes) file is used in a standard RBR installation (without
;       Pacenote plugin installed).
;       This is an optional entry and should be supplied especially in corners
;       and obstacles or hazards.
;
;   column=<COLUMN_INDEX>
;       See description above.
