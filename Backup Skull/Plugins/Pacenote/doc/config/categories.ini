;
; This file lists the available categories.
;
; The pace notes are grouped into categories.
; Each category represents a TAB in the pacenote properties UI dialog.
;
; This file is processed in order, so the ordering of the categories and notes
; in the file reflects the order of the TABs and pacenotes in the pacenote
; properties UI dialog.
;
; You can define as many categories as you want.
;
; Note:
; An internal, fixed category MODIFIER is always shown in the UI as the second
; TAB. This one contains the pre-defined flags being used by the legacy RBR
; implementation and some additions.
;
;
; A category is defined as follows:
;
; [CATEGORY::<CATEGORY_NAME>]
; file=<FILE_NAME>
; file0=<FILE_NAME 0>
; file1=<FILE_NAME 1>
;
; where
;   <CATEGORY_NAME>
;       The unique name of the category.
;       This name is being translated in the corresponding language specific
;       strings.ini file.
;
;   <FILE_NAME>
;       The name of the file containing the pacenotes definitions.
;       There is no limit on the number of files, as long as the key, e.g.
;       "file1" is prefixed by "file" and unique.
